HealthyTravel - Walkable Cities. Currently html file displays some example cities which can be clicked for more information, such as weather, country, population etc. 

This is a small test application using vanilla js (no framework). The goal is to explore the recent additions to javascript (such as async/await) and some public APIs. I'm not focusing on graphic design, so the html/css is very basic.
