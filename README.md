HealthyTravel - Walkable Cities. Currently the html file displays some example cities which can be clicked for more information, such as weather, country, population etc. 

This is a small application using vanilla js (no framework). The goal is to explore the recent additions to javascript (such as async/await) and some public APIs. These APIS are free and may not always work. 

The html/css is very basic, as I'm not focusing on graphic design.
